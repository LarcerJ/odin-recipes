    <h4>This is an easy chicken Parm recipe that's delicious. You can do this in an oven or a toaster oven.</h4>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>4 slices mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups tomato sauce, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray. 
            Place chicken on the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, flipping chicken after 12 minutes. Remove from 
            the oven, add desired amount of sauce, and top each breast with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run 
            clear, about 12 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should 
            read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
